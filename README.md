# [Occupational Therapist Finder]()

As a user I am in a place where I do not reside and I need a therapist for an immediate injury to prevent further damage.

As a therapist I have experienced less favorable outcomes in patient recovery when treatment is delayed.

## What is the Occupational Therapist Finder?

The idea behind the therapist finder is to get a licensed therapist who can assist you with the recovery process for an injury. The process between injury and becoming well again can sometimes be complicated, scary, and confusing. Making sure you have the right person to assist you along the way is imperative as long term injury can result with improper recovery steps.

The Therapist Finder takes care of some of the scary stuff like finding out what insurance the individual accepts and their qualifications. Additionally, their license is personally checked by our team to make sure there are no sanctions against them before you schedule a visit. With some of the uncertain variables of the typical trip to the doctor taken care of, your peace of mind is our goal.

## Our motivation

Primarily the motivation for this project was to make the process of going to get an injury looked at by a qualified professional more transparent. We wanted to make sure that when you look for an Occupational Therapist, you can find multiple competent individuals who we personally believe are well suited to assist. Finding one therapist can sometimes be a challenge so having many options in one location was paramount to us.

Additionally, one of our contributors has broken their hand in a foreign country. This luckily did not lead to any loss of motion but the search for a therapist was difficult. Finding the right person to assist you in the healing and recovery process will reduce the likelihood that you have issues down the line.

## How do I use the Occupational Therapist Finder?

The finished product (as well as any other builds that may be released) will be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The URL for our website has been included in the links at the end of this README as well as anywhere you see our name.

## FAQ

### `How do you check if your doctor has a sanction?`

Through [LARA](https://www.michigan.gov/lara/) you are able to check for any kind of reports or allegations. These are public records and anyone is able to access them. 

### `How did the therapists on your site make it on there?`

We aim to make the process of finding an Occupational Therapist easier by personally assessing if everyone on our website is a good candidate. If there is a doctor on our website, that means that we have gone through the process of verifying their credentials.

### `Can I add a therapist who I think should be on your website?`

Yes you can submit a therapist for review from one of our admins. We contact each therapist to make sure they want to be advertised on our site and if they meet our requirements, they will be added.
